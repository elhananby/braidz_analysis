## Braidz Analysis Package Internal Documentation

[Linked Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)


### 1. Introduction

This document provides internal documentation for the `braidz_analysis` Python package.  The package is structured to modularize different aspects of braid analysis, including data processing, plotting, helper functions, trajectory analysis, braid manipulation, filtering techniques, and parameter management.


### 2. Package Structure

The `braidz_analysis` package is organized into several submodules:

| Module Name      | Description                                         |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `processing`     | Contains functions for processing raw braid data.    |
| `plotting`       | Provides functions for visualizing braid data and analysis results. |
| `helpers`        | Includes general-purpose helper functions used throughout the package. |
| `trajectory`    | Implements functions for analyzing trajectories within braid structures. |
| `braidz`         | Contains core functions for manipulating and analyzing braid data structures. |
| `filtering`      | Provides functions for filtering noise from braid data. |
| `params`         | Manages parameters used across different modules.     |


### 3. Module-Level Imports and Public Interface

The package uses relative imports to import its submodules:

```python
from . import processing
from . import plotting
from . import helpers
from . import trajectory
from . import braidz
from . import filtering
from . import params
```

The `__all__` variable defines the public interface of the package, specifying which submodules should be imported when using the wildcard import `from braidz_analysis import *`:

```python
__all__ = ["processing", "plotting", "helpers", "trajectory", "braidz", "filtering", "params"]
```


### 4.  Detailed Module Descriptions (Placeholder -  Requires further expansion with code examples and algorithm details from individual modules)

This section requires further elaboration with specific details from each module, including:

* **`processing`**:  A description of the algorithms used for data cleaning, normalization, and preprocessing.  Include details on handling missing data, outlier detection, and data transformations.
* **`plotting`**:  Explanation of the plotting libraries used and the types of visualizations provided. Details on customization options and algorithm for plot generation (e.g., specific plot types and their underlying mechanisms).
* **`helpers`**:  Documentation for each helper function, clarifying their purpose and usage.
* **`trajectory`**: Description of algorithms used to track trajectories, analyze their properties (e.g., velocity, acceleration), and identify significant events.
* **`braidz`**: Detailed explanation of data structures used to represent braids and algorithms for braid manipulation, analysis (e.g., braid word calculation, topological properties).
* **`filtering`**: Description of the filtering algorithms used (e.g., moving average, Kalman filter, wavelet denoising) and their implementation.
* **`params`**: Explanation of how parameters are stored and accessed. This might include details on configuration file handling or a parameter class.
